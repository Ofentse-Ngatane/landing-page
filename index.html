            <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
              Network outages often go undetected until the user experience
              starts to suffer. With NetBrain, you will continuously assess the
              behavior of the network based on its desired goals, providing
              operational insight before problems being to impact the business.
              <br />

                Configuration drift and the unintended consequences of change

              <li>Failover provisions that are inoperative or inadequate</li>
              <li>Performance degradation over time</li>

              Network automation enables change management to enhance service

              evaluating the success of those intents before and after change

              Traditional network assessments are outdated and time-consuming.
              They are limited in scope and only sample portions of the network,

              service degradation.
              <br />
              Continuous Network Assessment uses no-code automation to let you
              capture and schedule checks (as Intents) for every aspect of your
              network on a regular basis so you can quickly identify and address
              any issues proactively. A comprehensive view of your entire
